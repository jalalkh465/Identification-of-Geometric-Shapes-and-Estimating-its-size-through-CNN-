# Identification-of-Geometric-Shapes-and-Estimating-its-size-through-CNN-

# Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of geometric shapes: triangle, circle, square, and star. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model achieves high accuracy in shape classification.
